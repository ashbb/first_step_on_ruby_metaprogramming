<h2>1. inherited() - a hook method</h2>

<p>The mechanical explanation is that the superclass knows if/when it is inherited by another class and can do something about it. </p>

<p>Ummm.. okay, but give me at least one example (even if that is not the full story) of why that allows you to do something otherwise not possible or why it is more elegant. </p>

<p>In the video we watched as part of this course, there was this example. </p>

<p>If I understand correctly, this allows an elegant way to set a <strong>class instance variable</strong>. Elegant in the sense that very little code exists at the subclass level (which is what the user will write, the superclass is framework). </p>

<p>The superclass not only contains the bulk of the code but also establishes a convention. In theory, each subclass can declare its own class instance variables, e.g. <code class="ruby">@table_name = "volumes"</code> but who would check if you made a typo? By having a method set_table_name, it is cleaner cuz typos will be caught at runtime and flagged.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># cheat_sheet_001.rb

module ActiveRecord
  class Base
    def self.set_table_name(new_name)

      # This is a class inst var and not an inst var
      # because it is a class method (self.xxx)
      # When this method is called, we want self to be the subclass 
      # and not Base class in order for this to work

      @table_name = new_name
    end

    def self.inherited(subcls)
      name = subcls.name.downcase + 's'

      # At this point, self is Base
      # Swith self to subclass by explicitly calling
      # set_table_name on subclass

      subcls.set_table_name(name)
    end
  end
end

class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name "volumes"
end

p Book.instance_variables                    #=&gt; ["@table_name"]
p Book.instance_variable_get(:@table_name)   #=&gt; "volumes"
