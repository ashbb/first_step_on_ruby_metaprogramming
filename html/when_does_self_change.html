<h2>When does self change?</h2>

<p>Only two things can change <strong>self</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>method call (when you call method)</p></li>
<li><p>class/module definition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Paolo Perrotta (*1) answered the question about <code class="ruby">self</code> in the trial beta course forum.</p>

<p>The point is not whether self has a meaning or not--it always does. The point is when the code is evaluated. Here's an example, slightly edited:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># self_explanation.rb

animal = "duck"

# We're at the top level here, so self is the main object.
self                # =&gt; main

class &lt;&lt; animal
  # We just entered the eigenclass (or "singleton class") of animal.
  # In here, self is the eigenclass:
  self      # =&gt; #&lt;Class:#&lt;String:0x6194c8&gt;&gt;

  # Let's call module_eval() on the eigenclass:
  self.module_eval do
    # This didn't change self:
    self      # =&gt; #&lt;Class:#&lt;String:0x6194c8&gt;&gt;

    # This method is defined as an instance method
    # of the eigenclass (a "singleton method").
    # The code in the method is not executed until we eventually
    # call the method.
    def speak_c; self.capitalize; end
  end
end

# OK, now let's call speak_c(). In the method,
# self is always the receiver object, so writing
# self.capitalize() is the same as simply writing
# capitalize():
animal.speak_c    # =&gt; "Duck"
</code></pre>
