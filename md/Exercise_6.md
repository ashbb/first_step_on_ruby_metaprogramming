	puts
	p fido.dance
	p fido.poo
	p fido.laugh
	puts
	p stimpy.dance
	p stimpy.poo
	p stimpy.laugh
  
**Output is:**

	"Lassie is dancing"   
	"Lassie is a smelly doggy!"   
	"Lassie finds this hilarious!"   
	
	"Fido don't understand dance"
	"Fido is a smelly doggy!"
	"Fido don't understand laugh"
	
	"Stimpy is dancing"
	"Stimpy don't understand poo"
